    " ans: List comprehension is a short way to create a new list from an old list, using a loop and optional if condition — all in one line.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "# new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "\n",
    "# expression: what you want to store in the new list\n",
    "\n",
    "# condition: filter which items to include\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterable: the original list or sequence\n",
    "\n",

    "# -> Shorter and cleaner than for + if blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "# -> Easier to read once you're familiar with the syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "# -> Great for filtering, mapping, or transforming lists\n"
